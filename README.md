This was my second year computer science project for Java/Internet Programming Laboratory. It was a basic project which required me to implement various Database and Internet banking functionalities. I coded the front-end with reference to State Bank of India's 2016 version of Internet banking.
Moreover, I implemented features for Account Withdrawal, Deposit, Transfer, Online Product Purchase and other Net Banking related features.

Features include:
1. Used MySQL Database, PHP for Scripts and HTML/CSS for Front End
2. Handled various threats like SQL Injection
3. Included session management and AES Encryption for security while transferring funds.

Note: This project used msql and not mysqli. Use XAMPP with appropriate version to run the above code without errors. Refer to output screenshots from the screenshots folder to build the database accordingly.
