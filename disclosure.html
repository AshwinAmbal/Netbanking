<h4>Availability of Internet Banking Service</h4>

<p>The customers' accounts are opened and maintained in the Bank's Core Banking Solution (CBS), which does not function on 24*7 basis. Internet Banking merely provides, for the convenience of the customers, certain types of viewing and / or transacting access to such accounts. Access to 
account(s) is allowed in the prescribed manner during the availability of the CBS.
Some of the services in Internet Banking are extended in conjunction with Other Source Systems (OSS) within or outside the Bank, which may or may not function on 24*7 basis. Such services will be available only when the OSS are functional. Availability of Internet Banking is also dependent upon availability of the network. In addition, Internet Banking will not be available during downtime.
Standing Instructions / Scheduled Transactions are executed during the day after 8 AM on the respective due dates, and the time taken to execute depends upon the workload on the various systems like Internet Banking, CBS and OSS.</p>
