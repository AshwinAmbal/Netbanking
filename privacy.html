<h3>Privacy Statement </h3>
<pre style="font-family:Times New Roman">The origins of Braces Brothers and Banking date back to 1806 when the Bank of Calcutta (later called the Bank of Bengal) was established. In 1921, the Bank of Bengal and two other Presidency banks (Bank of Madras and Bank of Bombay) were amalgamated to form the Imperial Bank of India . In 1955, the controlling interest in the Imperial Bank of India was acquired by the Reserve Bank of India and the Braces Brothers and Banking (BBB) came into existence by an act of Parliament as successor to the Imperial Bank of India . In the Indian Financial world, BBB is synonymous with trust and security.
